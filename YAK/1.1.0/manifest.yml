  Make wire connection much faster.
  
  
  You can enable it on canvas toolbar.
  
  
  When dragging the wire and release on blank, you'll be able to choose which object you want to connect with on the tab control.
  
  
  You can also edit the items in tab control. Just right click the tab icon and you'll see an edit window. And your settings are under Settings Folder called quickwires.json.
  
  
  Single click to wire is available.
